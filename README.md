# ValidateStringsDFA

This project allows the user to provide input for 2 problems.

1. This problem returns the number of strings of a given length N in the language. The language consists of {a, b, c, d} and any substring 
in the given string is considered valid if for every 6 consecutive letters, those letters contain at least 1 occurence of each symbol.

2. Given an integer k >= 0 and a set of unique integers 0-9, this problem returns the smallest integer N (if any) that is a multiple of k, 
only made up of symbols in the given set. This includes an implementation of BFS.
